## Project Assignment pt 3: week 2 - Air Pollution

## A function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate
## and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold.
## The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. If no monitors meet the
## threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0.

## Find how many complete cases in the data set.
## From previous function, nobs are complete data. To view, use 'complete(1:332)' to see data then 'sum(nobs)'
# [1] 2505


corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0) {
    id = 1:332
    filename <- list.files(path = "specdata", pattern = ".csv", full.names = TRUE)
    
    result <- vector(mode ="numeric", length = 0)
    
    for (i in seq(filename)) {
        airquality <- read.csv(filename[i])
        complete_data <- complete.cases(airquality)
        airquality <- airquality[complete_data, ]
        
        if(nrow(airquality) > threshold) {
            correlation <- cor(airquality[["sulfate"]], airquality[["nitrate"]])
            result <- append(result, correlation)
        }
